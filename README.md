# Transfer-Learning-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of Transfer Learning for image classification, leveraging pre-trained models to improve training efficiency and accuracy on a new dataset. We use a pre-trained model and adapt it to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.
